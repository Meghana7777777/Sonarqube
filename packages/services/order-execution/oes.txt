ALTERS:



alter table p_cut_rm add column ref_component varchar(5) not null after components;
















order creation, order qty update, ratios, markers, dockets, cut jobs

Pre Requisites
1. delete the order qty update related screens and tables
2. delete the op version  related screens and tables
3. delete the current po related tables


Note: DON'T change the poSerial column name in the entities. 
While creating the order in OES, rename the proc_serial as po_serial so entire CPS and OES have it as po_serial



--------------------- OES  -------------------------------
Changes Proposed
1. processing order creation - get the same from KMS
    a. auto populate cut RM 
    b. auto populate cut RM size Props 
    c. po_sub_line_bundle get the same from KMS
    d. psl features populate
2. get the info of the po only (header info / features) from OES for all the cutting related screens wherever the poSerial is passed



1. order creation - get from KMS
2. order qty update - NA
3. op version - add style, color, product_code, product_type in the op_version
    and modify the op_sequence table population w.r.t OMS
4. Po ratios - add the sub process name in the ratio screen
5. Markers - get the marker types master to global masters
6. add a new column ref_component in cut_rm. While generating the cut,take this ref component and create the panels.
    add 1 component per fabric. The ref_component name is C1, C2, C3, C4


UI 

change the drop down in all places to 

style  -> Mo numbers (multi select)  for proceeding the PO / create   (same as in KMS)





------------------------ CPS -----------------------------------


1. when the docket is generated, we will save the PSL mapping for the docket. This should be done when you confirm the dockets.
    The left over qty has to be get from the po_sub_line  and accumulation from docket_psl_map

    docket_psl_map
    docket_bun_psl_map
    So when generating the panels, we can easily map the psl_ids by using the docket_bun_psl_map
    panels are mandatory to be generated only for the main item and only 1 component under the main docket (pick any 1 component)
    add psl_id, bundle_barcode in the docket_panel (bundle_barcode will be updated after the bundling activity)


    After the cut is reported, we will update the shade to the panels
