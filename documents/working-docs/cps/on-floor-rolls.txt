entity: on_floor_rolls

Q1: When do we populate data to on floor rolls?
Ans: When we do the cut reporting, then after the cut reporting job is done, 
    then we will trigger the 
    job: CPS_PEN_ROLLS_TO_ONFLOOR with the 
    function: releaseLockedRollsOfDocketToOnFloor() 
    input: LayIdRequest

Ans: All the rolls that were the part of the specific lay_id,
    will be moved to the on floor rolls.
    1. If the specific roll is not utilized in cut reporting, then the consumed qty for such rolls in the on-floor rolls will be 0 (i.e the roll is allocated but physically is not a part of the cutting)
    2. If the roll is part of the cut reporting, then the entire allocated roll quantity will be upated as the consumed qty in the on-floor-rolls


Q3. When do we change the status of the roll from on-floor to somewhere else
Ans: When the rolls are readily available in the on-floor-rolls entity, then we will be moving those rolls into the Warehouse.
    In this case, user will select the location and select the reason and enter the remarks before confirmation.

Ans: Only those rolls that have the pending qty available. i.e Total roll qty - total consumed qty 

Q4. When do we confirm that a roll is received from the cutting floor to Warehouse.

    2. By scanning the roll barcode itself and confirming
